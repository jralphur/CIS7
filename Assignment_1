#35: outputs 1.0, 5.1, 2.4 7.2
C++ code that follows the pseudocode in the book:
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int
main(void)
{
    double x;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; ++i) {
        std::cin >> x;
        if (((x < 5.0) && (2 * x < 10.7)) || sqrt( 5 * x ) > 5.1)
            std::cout << x;
    }
}

#37: if (not(Value 1 < Value2))  then
	... rest of the function here

#38: Yes:
    A: false; B: false; C: true
    ((A ^ B)' ^ C) -> statement1 if true
    statement 2 if false
    (A ^ B)' evaluates to true
    ^ C does not change the truth value;
    statement 1 then executes since the whole if statement is true.


#61 "At least one of us is a liar."
    If Perceival is a liar, then his statement is false.  If his statement is negated, then both characters
	should be truth tellers, leading to an impossible situation considering
	that Percival is a liar.
	Since it leads into an impossible situation and the characters are or are not liars,
    Percival is telling the truth, making LLewellyn a liar.

#62: "If I am a truth teller, then Meredith is a truth teller." 
    If Merelin was lying, then his (negated) statement would be:
	"I am telling the truth and Meredith is a liar", but since Merlin
	is lying, this is an impossible situation.
	Therefore Merlin must be a truth teller.
    Since Merlin is a truth teller, then Meredith must also be a truth teller.

#63:"Either I am a liar or Grymlin is truth teller."
    Let us assume that Rothwold is lying, a lie statement would be:
    A' ^ B'
	"I am telling the truth and Grymlin is lying".
	But since Rothwold is lying, this statement is impossible.
	Rothwold must then be a truth teller.
	Since Rothwold is truthteller, we can assume that Grymlin is a truth teller since he is not a liar

#64 "I am a liar but Merrilaine is not."
	If Gwendolin is telling the truth, then she is a liar and Merrilaine is a truthteller; however,
    this leads to an impossibility: Gwedolin says she is a liar despite being a truth teller.
    Therefore, she must also be a liar and her combined statement A^B (A: "I am a liar" & B: "Merrilaine is telling the truth") is false.
	Gwendolin AND Merrilaine must be liars.
