exhaustive method:
    25: 5 * 5; 16 + 9
    100: 10 * 10; 25 + 4;
    169: 13 * 13; 25 + 144;

let x be odd, expressed as (2n + 1)
let y be odd, expressed as (2n + 1);
x + y is then (2n + 1) + (2n + 1)
which equals 4n + 2
which equals 2(2n + 1)
let 2n + 1 be k
then, 2k 
therefore x + y is even
alternatively, since (2n + 1) is being multiplied by two, 2 * (2n + 1) is even;


sum of even x and x^2 is even
hyp: x + x^2 = even number
= (2n) + (2n)^2 
= 2n + 4n^2
= 4n^2 + 2n
= 2(n^2 + 2)
= let k = n^2 + 2
therefore 2k, and 2k is even

if n^2 is odd -> n is odd;
assume n^2 is odd, then n is even
then, (2n+1)^2 -> (2n)
however, (2n +1)^2 = (4n^2 + 4n + 1)
then = 2(2n^2 + 2n) + 1
let k be the integer 2n^2 + 2n
then 2k + 1, which is odd
by contraction, n^2 is odd -> n is odd
